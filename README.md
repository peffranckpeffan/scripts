# Fully automated binding free energy calculations with restraints

Franck Peffan, Germano Heinzelmann

In this repository we present a software for automated rigorous binding free energy calculations, using the method of Umbrella Sampling with restraints for protein-protein binding. The scripts we present include the creation of the systems, with the various windows needed for the free energy calculations, as well as the subsequent free energy analysis. We use mainly the VMD and NAMD sofwares for the creation of the system and the simulations, and the method of Multistate Bennet Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) for the analysis of the simulations and retrieval of the standard binding free energy.
